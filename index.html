About fORAGER
</h1>
<p>
<h4>What</h4>
 fORAGER is an app that depends on image recognition and data. We implement a database of all of the regional edible plants, and use a photo of them to recognize them. Once the user identifies the plant, they have the option to eat it or not eat it. The user must survive as long as possible by finding edible plants to keep their energy up.

  <h4>Why</h4>
<p> When we first came up with this idea, we were trying to find a way to make people care about climate change. During the ideation phase, we decided to create awareness through gamification of big data. Combining machine learning, and image recognition, fORAGER educates people about the fauna that is indigenous to their area. We aim to create a engaging and addictive environment where regular people will be inspired to learn about their local area, plus it gets people out and about! </p>
